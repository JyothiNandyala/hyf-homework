Pulihora
Preparation:
 firstly, i would heavily recommend preparing this recipe with 
 short-grained rice like sona masuri or jasmine rice. avoid using 
 basmati rice which may not perfectly gel with spices and tamarind 
 sauce. secondly, avoid using freshly cooked rice for this recipe.
  use rested or cooled down rice which should not have moisture in it. 
  the freshly cooked rice would have moisture in it and when mixed with
  spices and sauce, it would lose its concentration. lastly, you can 
  always pre-make the spices and sauce concentration and use it 
  whenever you wish to make this rice recipe.
