Agra Tourism
Located on the banks of River Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh, Agra is a
popular tourist destination as it is home to one of the 7 wonders 
of the world, the Taj Mahal. It is a sneak peek into the
architectural history and legacy of the Mughal empire with two other
UNESCO World Heritage Sites Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. History,
architecture, romance all together create the magic of Agra, 
and hence, makes for a must-visit for anyone living in or visiting
India.
Agra is one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh and 24th most populous city in India. With its long and rich history, it is no wonder that Agra forms part of the popular Golden Triangle Circuit for tourists along with Delhi and Jaipur. It is also a part of the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc including Varanasi and Lucknow. History fanatics and architecture buffs are sure to have a ball here with the sheer expanse of the Mughal art and culture on display.

Apart from its monuments, Agra has some exciting stuff for foodies. It is as famous for its Petha (a sweet made from pumpkin and flavoured with rose water and saffron) as it is for the Taj Mahal. Agra is also well known for its marble artefacts which are best bought in the Sadar Bazaar or Kinaari Bazaar area. 

Agra is mostly visited on a one-day trip from New Delhi or other nearby cities in Uttar Pradesh but is totally worth it. Be prepared to be astounded, amazed, inspired and thrilled. However, be a little cautious about conmen in the guise of unofficial tour guides and fake handicrafts.
